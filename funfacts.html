        "Actor Ryu Jun-yeol recently addressed the rumours surrounding his relationships with actresses Han So-hee and Hyeri. The actor, known for his roles in popular K-dramas such as 'Reply 1988' and 'Lucky Romance', found himself at the center of speculation regarding his personal life, prompting him to break his silence on the matter. During a press event for his upcoming series 'The 8 Show', he acknowledged the rumours but chose to refrain from divulging further details, stating that he believed it was best to maintain silence amidst the public scrutiny. 'I felt it was best to keep silent and put up with the criticism rather than trying to correct the misinformation about my personal life that was spread on social media. As it is about my personal life, I think I would like to give a separate interview at some other time', he said. Netizens scrutinised the actors' every move, particularly as Han So-hee and Hyeri's alleged social media feud added fuel to the fire. Despite public outcry and criticisms, Ryu Jun-yeol chose to maintain a stoic silence, refusing to engage with the ongoing controversy. While Han So-hee clarified the timeline of her relationship with Ryu Jun-yeol, their short-lived romance ultimately succumbed to external pressures and ended after a mere two weeks."
